# snpboost
An algorithm to apply statistical boosting on genotype data via a batch-based approach as described in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.489836v1.

snpboost includes R functions in which the boosting algorithm is implemented.

Simulations provides R Code and bash scripts that were used to run the simulation on phenotypes based on UKBB genotype data and fit statistical boosting models on those.

UK_biobank_application provides R scripts that were used to fit snpboost and snpnet models on UKBB data.
